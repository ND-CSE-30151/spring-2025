What is the conclusion or \"then\" part of the statement to be proven? You may want to rewrite the statement in a more explicit way. For example, you might rewrite the above statement as: If $L$ is a language over an alphabet $\\Sigma$, then $L^\\ast = \\{\\varepsilon\\} \\cup (L \\circ L^\\ast)$. You might also review the definitions of union ($\\cup$), concatenation ($\\circ$), and Kleene star ($\\ast$).\n",
