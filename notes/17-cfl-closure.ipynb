Here's a partial table of closure properties:\n","\n","| Operation | Regular | Context-free |\n","|:----------|:--------|:-------------|\n","| union     | yes     | yes          |\n","| concatenation | yes | yes          |\n","| Kleene star | yes   | yes          |\n","| complementation | yes | **no**     |\n","| intersection | yes  | **no**       |\n","| intersection with regular | yes | yes |\n","| string homomorphism | yes | yes |\n","\n","**Question.** Can you show that context-free languages are closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene star?\n","\n","The fact that context-free languages are _not_ closed under complementation or intersection will be the subject of a homework problem.\n","\n","The proof of closure under a string homomorphism $\\phi$ is very similar to the proof for NFAs, but applied to PDAs: essentially, every transition that reads input $a$ is replaced with zero or more transitions that read $\\phi(a)$ (like in Figure 2.23).\n","\n","The proof of closure under intersection with a regular language is very similar to the intersection construction for DFAs, but applied to a PDA and a DFA. The details are not necessary for you to learn, but here's the construction:\n","\\begin{align*}\n","P &= (Q_P, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta_P, s_P, F_P) \\\\\n","M &= (Q_M, \\Sigma, \\delta_M, s_M, F_M) \\\\\n","P \\cap M &= (Q_P \\times Q_M, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, (s_P, s_M), F_P \\times F_M) \\\\\n","\\delta((q, r), a, x) &= \\{ ((q', \\delta_M(r, a)), x') \\mid (q', x') \\in \\delta_P(q, a, x) \\} \\\\\n","\\delta((q, r), \\varepsilon, x) &= \\{ ((q', r), x') \\mid (q', x') \\in \\delta_P(q, \\varepsilon, x) \\}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","### Example: the copy language\n","\n","One example of where this is useful is the language $B = \\{ww\\}$ from last time. Suppose that $B$ is context-free. Then $B \\cap \\texttt{0}^\\ast\\texttt{1}^\\ast\\texttt{0}^\\ast\\texttt{1}^\\ast = \\{\\texttt{0}^m\\texttt{1}^n\\texttt{0}^m\\texttt{1}^n\\}$ must also be context-free. Now we proceed to use the pumping lemma on this new language. It's similar to our proof from last time, but the case analysis is simpler:\n","\n","- If $vxy$ lies in region I-II: Then $s'$ cannot belong to $\\{\\texttt{0}^m\\texttt{1}^n\\texttt{0}^m\\texttt{1}^n\\}$ because there are fewer $\\texttt{0}$'s in region I than region III, or fewer $\\texttt{1}$'s in region II than region IV.\n","- If $vxy$ lies in region II-III or III-IV: Similar.\n","\n","### Example: filtering out nuisance strings\n","\n","Another example: Prove that\n","\\begin{equation}\n","F = \\{\\texttt{a}^n \\texttt{b}^n \\texttt{c}^n \\mid \\text{$n$ even}\\} \\cup \\{\\texttt{a}^i \\texttt{b}^j \\texttt{c}^k \\mid \\text{$i$ odd} \\}\n","\\end{equation}\n","is not context-free.\n","\n","If you try to use the pumping lemma directly on this language, you'll run into trouble with the case where $vxy$ is all $\\texttt{a}$'s. You can form a string $s' = uv^lxy^lz$, but if $s'$ has an odd number of $\\texttt{a}$'s, then you won't be able to show that $s'$ doesn't belong to $F$.\n","\n","Instead, suppose that $F$ is context-free. Then $F \\cap (\\texttt{aa})^\\ast \\texttt{b}^\\ast \\texttt{c}^\\ast$ must also be context-free (because CFLs are closed under intersection with regular languages).
