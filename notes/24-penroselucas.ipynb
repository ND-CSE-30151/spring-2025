I want to present to you one argument for the \"no\" position. Turing called it \"the mathematical objection,\" and while some form of it goes back to Gödel, it is usually known today as the Penrose-Lucas argument. This version, which is an interesting variation on the diagonalization argument for the undecidability of the halting problem, is due to Penrose and comes from [an article criticizing him](http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/pub/lafortehayesford.pdf). Although I agree with the conclusion, I don't agree with the argument -- what do you think about it?\n","\n","Let $R$ be a \"partial loop-snooper,\" a decider TM that detects _some_ cases of looping.
